# CivOne

Bugfixes and enhancements to SWY's original. The primary goal is to emulate CIV Dos as closely as convenient, 
barring those areas where no one knows exactly how CIV Dos works. Some cheats and features will be provided
as 'patches', accessible via the setup menu.

I will be trying to make weekly releases for the foreseeable future. See the Releases page for details.

**NOTE:**
This program is not complete in itself. You need to have a copy of the files from CIV Dos! In addition, in order
to use sound support, you need the sound files from CIV Win.
